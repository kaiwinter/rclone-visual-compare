# rclone: visual compare
This tool provides a JavaFX UI to visually compare two folders (local or remote).
This is done by using the `clone check` command with afterwards parsing of its output.
The UI provides simple functions like deleting one file on one of both sides or showing a preview of images.
More to come.
